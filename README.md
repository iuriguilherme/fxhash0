To test the generative token, assuming node.js is already installed in the 
system (instructions on how to set this up are outside the scope of this 
document and I don't like the process to write it down, may the force be with 
you):  

```
$ git clone https://github.com/iuriguilherme/fxhash0.git  
$ cd fxhash0  
$ npm -i  
$ npm run start  
```

If that doesn't work, look for further instructions:
